# HardyZ
Calculate Values of the Hardy Z Function

## Overview

We provide here a C program to calculate *Z(t)*, the Hardy Z function, for 't' a positive real number.  Our program uses 
the Riemann-Siegel Formula.  

The included PDF file briefly describes the mathematics behind the calculations.  Here we will just mention
that, for any given 't', the calculations compute a "main" term *M* and an approximate "remainder" term *R(4)*,
with *R(4)* a very close approximation of the actual remainder term *R*. We then have *Z(t) = M + R(4)*.

Much greater detail on the mathematics is given in my book: 
*A Study of Riemann's Zeta Function* by Terrence P. Murphy.  The book is available on Amazon.  Go [here][website-link] to 
view the Table of Contents and Preface for all of my books.

The source code is intended for use with the **gcc** compiler and the **MPFR** floating point library.  Although only tested on 
64-bit Windows 11, I believe the source code is portable to other operating systems.

## Files

This distribution consists of the following files:

  * [README.md][readme-link]. The file you are currently reading.
  
  * [license.txt][license-link] A text file containing the MIT License which applies to this work.
	
  * [Hardyz.c][hardyz-c-link]. The `main` function entry pont for our program.  This source code file is 
  quite straightforward. We validate the user‚Äôs command line input, save their
  choices and then call the `ComputeHardyZ` function.

  * [remainder256.c][remainder256-c-link]. This source code file provides the 
  `ComputeRemainder256` function that computes the remainder term *R(4)*.
  We use the Gabcke table of power series coefficients and the **MPFR** library (set to 256-bit by default and changeable by the `-b` command line
  parameter) for other floating point calculations.
 
  * [remainder128.c][remainder128-c-link]. The functions in this file are called only when you use the ‚Äù-d‚Äù debug switch with a debug value
divisible by 2. In that case, the ‚Äúremainder‚Äù term ùëÖ is computed by calling the ComputeRemainder128
 function.  We use the **gcc** quadmath 128-bit floating point library for the Haselgrove
  coefficients, and the **MPFR** library for all other floating point calculations.
 
  * [remainder.c][remainder-c-link]. Here we provide an alternate function, `ComputeRemainder`, for computing the remainder term.  Like 
the `ComputeRemainder128` function, we compute *R(4)* using the Haselgrove table of power series coefficients.
The difference is that, here, we use the **gcc** compiler's built-in **long double** floating point type (with 80-bit precision on our computer system).
We no longer link to this file.  It is here because the source code in this file more clearly shows the *R(4)* algorithm for computing the remainder term.  
Our testing showed a slight accuracy improvement (and a minimal time cost) when using `ComputeRemainder256`.

  * [buildcoeff.c][buildcoeff-c-link]. This source code file builds an **MPFR** version of the Gabcke power series coefficients as part of the
overall task of initializing the **MPFR** floating point system.

  * [computetheta.c][computetheta-c-link]. This source code file uses the MPFR floating point library to compute the
    theta term in the Riemann-Siegel Formula. 
 
  * [computemain.c][computemain-c-link]. This source code file is ‚Äúcentral control‚Äù for computing 
  *Z(t)* values. The `ComputeHardyZ` function is the entry point. In that function, we
  do needed initialization of the **MPFR** floating point system, call either `ComputeRemainder256`
  or `ComputeRemainder128`, call the `ComputeMain` function (found in this source code file), and 
  print the results to `stdout`.
  
  * [hardyz.h][hardyz-h-link]. The is the only (local) include file for the program.  
  
  * [makehardyz.bat][makehardyz-bat-link]. The is the "makefile" for the program.  Currently,
  this file is a Windows batch file (**not** an actual makefile), but can be easily converted to 
  a standard makefile.
  
  * [hardyz.pdf][hardyz-pdf-link]. A PDF file with further discussion of our software, the building
  of our software program, and the mathematics behind our software. The PDF is created using LaTex, 
  needed to allow proper display / layout of the mathematics.
